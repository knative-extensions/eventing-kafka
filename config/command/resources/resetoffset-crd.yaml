            reposition the Kafka Topic/Partition Offsets of a specific ConsumerGroup as referenced
            by a Subscription / Trigger, etc.  The ResetOffset status tracks the progress of the
            steps involved in this repositioning. Once the Succeeded status is set (true / false),
            the ResetOffset is "finished" and cannot be re-executed.  Another ResetOffset will be

                    implementations (Channels, Brokers, etc) to support the ResetOffset CRD without
                    changing the schema. Each such implementation is responsible for validating and
                    rejecting unsupported referenced types.  For example, the KafkaChannel Controller
                    will only support Subscriptions and will reject any other reference type, while
                    the KafkaBroker implementation might do the same for Triggers.  Check your
